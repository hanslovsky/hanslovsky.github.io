# Releasing Software Libraries with Semantic Versioning and GitHub Actions

Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) has been a powerful tool that allows for frequent and (semi-) automated releases of software. Among the benefits are rapid distribution of new features to te consumer and smaller changelogs to facilitate identifying and fixing bugs. Typically, CI/CD includes two components: 
 - Source & version control management (SCM/VCS) software like [Git](https://git-scm.com/) that track all changes to the code base and infrastructure. Generally, SCM should be considered the single source of truth for a code base.
 - CI/CD tools like [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) or [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) that test all code changes and deploy releases into library repositories or applications onto (production) servers.

Ideally, CI/CD is tightly integrated with SCM to maximize automation, e.g. run automatic tests on every code change proposal. In my experience, making automated releases through CI/CD while honering SCM as the single source of truth for versioning has been a challenge: Often, releases are triggered through the CI/CD tools, when it should be driven by the version in a project-specific file, e.g. `gradle.properties` [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) or `pom.xml` for [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). In the past, I have used the great [scijava-scripts](https://github.com/scijava/scijava-scripts) collections to generate releases. While it honors SCM as single source of truth, I see two major downsides:
 1. Releases are made by pushing to the default branch, preventing branch protection of the default branch or peer-review of releases in pull requests.
 2. The tagged release commit is not on the default branch, i.e. there will be no release commits on the default branch.

Overall, the scijava-scripts works so flawlessly for Maven that I never bothered to think about solutions for these downsides. Recently, I started work on a Gradle project ([nta.kt](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/ntakt)) and had to think about implementing CI/CD. I had onboarded nta.kt to Travis CI and [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/), which worked sufficiently well for CI but I did not have a simple solution for CI/CD. I had heard about GitHub Actions before but I had not explored what it has to offer until very recently. I decided to give it a try for nta.kt and have been impressed by the ease of use and integration with GitHub. I was able to create [workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference#workflow-syntax) for creating releases that
 1. are triggered through the GitHub UI,
 2. are integrated into the default branch through pull requests (branch protection + peer-review), and
 3. honor `gradle.properties` as single source of truth for the version.

Creating a release is really simple now:
 1. Create a [release request issue](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/ntakt/issues/new?assignees=&labels=release+request&template=request-release.md&title=%5BRELEASE%5D), e.g. [saalfeldlab/ntakt#37](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/ntakt/issues/37). The [`release request tag`](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/ntakt/blob/950cdff19d75a6017b0771ed898d06fd4fadb116/.github/workflows/release.yaml#L16) will
 2. trigger a pull request (PR) with two commits, e.g. [saalfeldlab/ntakt#38](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/ntakt/issues/38):
    1. [Set version in `gradle.properties` to non-`SNAPSHOT`](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/ntakt/blob/950cdff19d75a6017b0771ed898d06fd4fadb116/.github/workflows/release.yaml#L36-L60). Currently, the release just removes `-SNAPSHOT`. Ideally, the current `-SNAPSHOT` version is updated with every code change or the release version could be inferred from the commit history following [Conentional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
    2. [Bump to next development cycle](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/ntakt/blob/950cdff19d75a6017b0771ed898d06fd4fadb116/.github/workflows/release.yaml#L61-L75): Increment patch version and add `-SNAPSHOT`.
 The release issue is closed automatically as soon as the pull request is created.
 3. After review, a maintainer will then **rebase merge the PR into the default branch to trigger release. Automatic releases will not work with any other merge options than rebase merge** (see the following steps for details).
 4. On any push (that includes PR merge) to default branch, a GitHub action will [trigger a release build](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/ntakt/blob/950cdff19d75a6017b0771ed898d06fd4fadb116/.github/workflows/build.yaml#L60-L62), [create a release](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/ntakt/blob/950cdff19d75a6017b0771ed898d06fd4fadb116/.github/workflows/build.yaml#L63-L73), and [attach artifacts to the release](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/ntakt/blob/950cdff19d75a6017b0771ed898d06fd4fadb116/.github/workflows/build.yaml#L74-L103), only if
    - [the commit message indicates bump to next development cycle](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/ntakt/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yaml#L35-L36), and
    - [the parent commit (`HEAD^`) has a non-`SNAPSHOT` version in `gradle.properties`](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/ntakt/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yaml#L44-L51).



All the required files are the GitHub Actions workflow definitions & helper scripts in  [`.github/workflows`](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/ntakt/tree/950cdff19d75a6017b0771ed898d06fd4fadb116/.github/workflows) and the [issue template for release requests](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/ntakt/blob/950cdff19d75a6017b0771ed898d06fd4fadb116/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/request-release.md). These files are currently still quite fluid with a bit of code duplication. It is possible that I will extract this funcitonality into one or more GitHub Actions available through the market place.
    
I found this to work quite well in the context of a small project with a single maintainer. I would expect this pattern to also work well in larger teams but a few things would need to be addressed first:

 1. There must be an automated way to set the release version. This has to happen either when the release pull request is created, or continously with every code change. This works best if branch protection for the default branch is enabled.
 2. It is unclear what to do with a release pull request when changes are pushed to the default branch. It may be best (and certainly most simple) to fail checks if any commits have been made to the default branch since the creation of the pull request. A new release pull request can then be created following the same pattern described above.
